            <h3>Welcome</h3>

            <p>The Loaves & Fishes program provides hot meals to approximately 200-350 local people twice a week. This number continues to increase as we continue to look for ways to impact families in the city of Fond du Lac that may not be able to provide nutritional meals to their families. The success of our mission relies solely on volunteers throughout the community. We encourage to you look over our website and contact us if you are interested in volunteering or making a charitable contribution to our cause.</p>

            <h3>Presidentâ€™s Note</h3>

            <p>The photos above are of the presentation of the " Pat O'Hearn Servent of the Poor Award" presented to Loaves and Fishes this past September by St. Vincent DePaul at their annual Servent of the Poor Banquet. A representation of the Loaves and Fishes Board of Directors was present at the event, and accepting on behalf of the organization is Dan O'Hearn, Pat's grandson, who currently serves on the Board of Directors. Dan spoke of the organization and the ever lasting legacy of his grandmother Pat. The award plaque is now being proudly displayed in the kitchen at the Church of Peace. Thank you all for everything each of you do to make our organization great.</p>
